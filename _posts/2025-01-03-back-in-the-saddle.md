After 4 years, I suppose I should make another post. This won't be too long. Just an update that we all survived Covid, didn't end up moving to Colorado, did end up changing jobs, and have watched time fly by.  
The kids are now nearly 12, 9.5, and 6.75 years old. I'm rounding the corner on 39!  
I'll try to do better about posting more regularly and catching up all my non-existent readers on the past 1400+ days.  
Until then, hasta luego.
